Analysis of Airbnb Seattle dataset. The 'listings.csv' and 'calendar.csv' files were used in the project.

## Libraries used

* os

## Project motivation
The goal of the project is to use the data on Airbnb Seattle listings to answer three main questions.

 1. Which features impact listing price?
 2. Are there any differences in prices offered by regular hosts and Superhosts?
 3. Which listings are the most booked and why?

## File description
Files in the repository are related to each individual question.

- listing_price.ipynb - Analysis of the features related to the listing price
